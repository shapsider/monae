monae: multi-modal single-cell integration and imputation

# Environment
Python version: python 3.8

Install the following dependencies via pip or conda:
```python
pip install muon
pip install torchbiggraph
pip install scanpy
pip install pytorch-ignite
pip install typing_extensions
pip install tensorboardX
pip install torch-1.11.0+cu113
```

# Dataset
Dataset processed (`dataset_monae`)ï¼š

link: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1lOjSVVIUQ3WmqTDUJzdxMQ?pwd=1etw 

For the raw data, select annotation file in `preprocess_1.py`:
```python
gtf="./src/bedtools/annotation/gencode.v42.chr_patch_hapl_scaff.annotation.gtf.gz", # Human
gtf="./src/bedtools/annotation/gencode.vM25.chr_patch_hapl_scaff.annotation.gtf.gz", # Mouse
```

# Example
## Trained Monae
See the monae example in the `notebook_monae`. Trained Monae model:

The models and datasets are organized as follows:
```python
--src
...
--notebook_monae
  --dataset_monae
  --model # trained monae model
  --integration.ipynb # for integration
  --imputation_rna2atac.ipynb # for cross-modal imputation (rna->atac)
  --imputation_atac2rna.ipynb # for cross-modal imputation (atac->rna)
```

In ipynb files, select one of four datasets: `pbmc, chen2019, ma2020, muto2021`.

## Auto infer guidance
A new version is provided here that can generate guidance without relying on annotation files, please refer to the dir `liu`. Run the following files in sequence:

1. 1_train_gnn.py
2. 2_graph_generation.py
3. 3_integration.py
4. 4_inference.ipynb

# Monae-Extension
At present, the repo released a stable and convenient training strategy for Monae's variant Monae-E. Run the following files in sequence:

1. preprocess_1.py: data preprocess and constructing graph guidance.
2. preprocess_2.py: Unified learning of cell and feature representations.
3. integration.py: Train model.

Take the PBMC dataset as an example, the trained model has been saved here: `dataset/pbmc/result/ckpt/monae.dill`. Loading trained model in `inference.ipynb`.

## Todo
- [ ] Complete training process for Monae and Monae-E
- [ ] Pipeline for generating gene networks
